# CGC for UPC: a more realistic calculation.

We provide the first calculation of two-gluon production at mid-rapidity in ultra-peripheral collisions  in the Color Glass Condensate framework. To estimate systematic uncertainty associated with poor understanding of  the wave function of the nearly real photon, we consider two diametrically different models: the dilute quark-antiquark dipole approximation and a 
vector meson, in which color charge density is approximated by  McLerran-Venugopalan model.  In the experimentally relevant range, the target nucleus can be faithfully approximated by highly saturated state. This simplification enables us to perform efficient numerical simulations and extract the two-gluon correlation functions.
